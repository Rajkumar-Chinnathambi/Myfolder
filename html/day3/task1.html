    <center><h1>My Success Story</h1></center>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> From a very early age she experienced a level of adversity and poverty that most people would struggle to overcome. She was born into poverty and a broken home in rural Mississippi. Her parents who were just 18 and 19 when they had her, split soon after she was born. This lead to her being taking in by her grand mother.</p>
    <h3>What hindered your success?</h3>
    <p>Inspirational stories are less about success, and more about how our heroes deal with setbacks, how they conquer their enemies and how they grow as human beings.

        Think about the last action movie you saw, or remind yourself of an biography that inspired you most.
        
        And ‚Ä¶ what kept you watching or reading on?
        
        Jack Reacher, for instance, deals with thugs to get to the truth. Tony Morrison wrote many bestsellers and won the Nobel Prize despite feeling like an impostor. Nelson Mandela survived</p>
        <h3>A success story builds over time</h3>
        <p>Whether you sell a product or provide a service, your success is not just about you.

            Your clients‚Äô success is your success, too.
            
            This is why testimonials are powerful sales tools, and normally you should include them on every web page‚Äîyour home page, about page, and each sales page.
            
            However, when I launched my new course a couple of weeks ago, I didn‚Äôt have time to ask for reviews.
            
            Most marketers would think I am crazy to launch a course without a single review. But I was running out of time, and didn‚Äôt want to delay the launch until next year. So, together with my co-author Kathy Keats, I forged ahead and launched.
            
            Could I sell the course without reviews?
            
            You bet.
            
            Over 230 people from 39 different countries purchased the course already (thank you!).
            
            How was that possible?
            
            I wasn‚Äôt selling to strangers.
            
            As bloggers, you and I share our stories over time.
            
            When you share your knowledge generously on your blog, people come to trust your advice. And when you write from the heart, your passion and personality shine through.
            
            That‚Äôs how your success story, warts and all, builds over time.
            
            And that‚Äôs how readers come to know and trust you.
            
            PS
            
            Here‚Äôs some early feedback on the course that Catherine Tuckwell posted on Instagram:
            
            
            
            And Christina Wielgolawski tweeted:
            
            
            Would you like to nurture a writing habit, too?
            
            And want to write with ease and joy?

            Henneke, taking your course will be a fun way of hanging out with fellow writer friends. I‚Äôve already gotten them hooked on your content. I can‚Äôt wait to take your course in the near future.

            Currently, I am writing an autobiographical novel. This is my first attempt to share my daily challenges while reaching out to others. After having read your blog, I am less confused and more educated in completing my story. The steps you proposed are encouraging and enlightening. Simply this, I have a blueprint with which to write more successfully.

            These lessons are pure gold for any writer who wants to grow her influence. And I agree. The best taste of success comes when your work changes people. Keep up the great work, Henneke!

            Very inspiring read. As usual. üôÇ
            
            For me, success isn‚Äôt the rags to riches story. As you say: It‚Äôs not ‚Äúpolished‚Äù.
            
            There aren‚Äôt successful and unsuccessful people. It‚Äôs not that simple. It‚Äôs a question of perspective. It depends on how you DEFINE success and if you are able to recognize the many small successes you achieve every single day. (I would even say: ‚ÄúSTOP defining success. Better use that time to work, to do something, to create!‚Äù)
            
            Sharing these little things can be much more inspiring to a lot of people because they can relate much better.
            
            For me, too, there‚Äôs a fine line between being proud of one‚Äôs one achievements and bragging. Here in Germany, it‚Äôs quite similar to what you described for the Netherlands. Everyone is quite eager to achieve something, especially in business, but talking about it or ‚Äì beware! ‚Äì being proud of it, is frowned upon.
            
            So writing your own success story even can have ‚Äútherapeutic‚Äù value. It‚Äôs a form of mindfulness. Not only for your readers but also for yourself.

            Thank you so much for your comment, Christian. I like your point about writing a success story as a form of mindfulness. I‚Äôve certainly found this to be the case. Writing can bring clarity and help make sense of what‚Äôs happening to in my life and what I find important. Since I‚Äôve started writing my blog, I‚Äôve learned so much about myself!

            Hi Henneke,
            
            Every time I read your blog post, there‚Äôs always a line that hits me.
            
            ‚ÄúSuccess isn‚Äôt a polished story. If you want to write a truly inspirational story, look for the gritty truth behind the success.‚Äù
            
            Fantastic.
            
            Plus, I have always been skeptical of sharing my vulnerabilities, but I realized that the majority of people support you. So it validates your point that it makes us human and relatable.
