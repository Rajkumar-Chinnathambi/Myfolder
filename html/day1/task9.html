    <p>But while I seemed to be doing well, my career progress didnâ€™t make me happy. I was losing connection with my self-identity. I merely pretended to be happy, with a smile painted on my face. Leaving my job initially <br><br> felt like a failure. Why did I give up on my ambitions? But leaving my job was one of the best decisions I have ever made because it helped me to discover what success means to me. For an online <br><br>'business, it seems easiest to define success in number of social media followers, web visitors or the amount of money we make.</p>
