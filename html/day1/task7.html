    <h3>My Success Story</h3>
    <p>I grew up in the Dutch countryside, where bragging is frowned upon.

        You’re not supposed to talk about your achievements, and success seems almost a dirty <br>
        
        So, the idea of writing my own success story seems bizarre.
        
        Yet, I’ve discovered that even an honest story about modest success can inspire readers and boost business.
        
        What’s more, you can write such a story without bragging, and without feeling self-conscious. You can be humble and still showcase your success. <br>
        
        Shall I show you how?
        
        Here’s the first question to ask yourself …
        
        What is success, really?
        In my corporate career, defining success seemed quite simple. <hr>
        
        Another step up the career ladder. A salary increase. More people reporting to me. A place in the board. <br><br><br>
        
        But while I seemed to be doing well, my career progress didn’t make me happy. I was losing connection with my self-identity. I merely pretended to be happy, with a smile painted on my face.
        
        Leaving my job initially felt like a failure. Why did I give up on my ambitions?
        
        But leaving my job was one of the best decisions I have ever made because it helped me to discover what success means to me.
        
        For an online business, it seems easiest to define success in number of social media followers, web visitors or the amount of money we make. <hr>
